"""The port's settings screens, which tools/ce_menus.py writes in place of the
PC version's (port/assets/menus/ce): laid out as its are (rows of a label and
a spinner over its row backgrounds, a line of help for the row chosen,
Defaults, OK and Cancel), with what this port has to set instead of what the
PC version had (no connection speed or texture quality: a window or the full
screen, the frame rate, the keyboard's own controls).

A row's spinner sets one of config.toml's settings (setting=, values=), or of
the profile being edited ("profile.<field>": the controller's settings), by
port/linux/game/menu_functions.c: "port setting load" shows its value,
"port settings save" (OK) writes those changed and applies them, "port
settings defaults" shows the defaults. Controls Setup binds the keyboard and
mouse's controls, by the functions the PC version names for it.
